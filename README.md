## Getting started

Contained below are instructions on how to run this project for those who would like to fork this repository to build their own portfolio.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Node Package Manager, the [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io), as well as a remote server with the ability to start a node.js script. 

Additionally, please create a `config.json` file based off of the `config.example.json` sample provided and place it in the same directory.

### Installation

```
npm install angular-cli -g
git clone https://github.com/lukeify/lukeify.git
cd lukeify
npm install
```

### Building

Five scripts are provided for execution at project build time:

* `frontend:dev`: Runs an Angular Hot Module Reloading environment at localhost:4200.
* `frontend:prod`: Compiles the frontend using ahead of time compilation and minification to be served by our backend.
* `backend:dev`: Runs the express.js server with a development environment flag.
* `backend:prod`: Runs the express.js server with a production environment flag.
* `twitter`: To be executed via cron at a user's desired frequency to gather tweets from their profile and store them locally to be served.

## Deployment

Push to GitHub, then from remote repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/lukeify/lukeify.git
npm install
npm run frontend:prod
```

Now ensure you have `./node/config.json` configured properly. Follow the exemplar configuration.

```
npm run backend:prod
```

Then, run `./public/app.js --prod` using your favorite keep-alive tool.

To run the twitter updating functionality, schedule a cron to call `node public/services/Twitter.js` at a frequency of your choosing.
